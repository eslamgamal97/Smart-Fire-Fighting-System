# Smart-Fire-Fighting-System

The System is worked in two states; The first, As an air conditioner when the temperature increases above the room temperature, A fan will work until the temperature back again, 
The second one; It is working as smart fire fighting when the fire is happening there are two probabilities the first is no one is in the fire so the system will put it out, the 
second if someone is in the fire so he may be injured so the system will recognize him and send an SOS to Emergency department. PID is used to make the system stable in air 
conditioning mode. IOT is used to notify the emergency department.
